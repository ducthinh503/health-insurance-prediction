# 🏥 Health Insurance Payment Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts **health insurance payment costs** based on personal and health-related attributes.  
The project includes **data analysis, model training**, and a **Streamlit web application** for interactive prediction.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Health insurance costs depend on multiple factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, smoking habits, and medical conditions.  
This project applies **machine learning regression models** to estimate insurance payment amounts and deploys the best model as a **web app**.
